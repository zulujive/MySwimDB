# MySwimDB
MySwimDB is a database dedicated to managing swim meets. It's free to use by anyone, and requires only some basic technical knowledge

Documentation can be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSNnKNEUtfAu7GS6suHqUaq75xMJVepXr2KJs3JEjJfDj62M2b3DAB3WkzdpACEHM6WFrMuyOrBIE3y/pub

At the moment, MySwimDB is only optimized for MacOS. Future versions may include a Windows or Linux optimized database, but this has not yet been decided.

The files in the repository are for LibreOffice Base and Writer, please download these before attempting to open files.

On occasion, the system will crash. The likely cause is pressing ⌘C, for some reason LibreOffice crashes quite a bit when you press ⌘C. Try instead to use the right-click method for copying things for now as this tends to crash less when you do so. We're currently only aware of this bug in 6.4.5.2, and we're testing it in version 7.3.1.3. 

This was created using LibreOffice 6.4.5.2, but can be run on 7.3.1.3
